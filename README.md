## Project Overview
The Physics Virtual Lab is an interactive web-based platform designed to simulate fundamental physics experiments through accurate, real-time simulations. This application provides students, educators, and physics enthusiasts with a virtual laboratory environment to explore and understand complex physics concepts without the need for physical equipment.

The platform features multiple experiments with adjustable parameters, real-time data visualization, and export capabilities, making it an excellent tool for both learning and teaching physics principles.

## Features
- **Interactive Simulations**: Real-time physics simulations with accurate calculations
- **Multiple Experiments**: Currently supports three core experiments with more to come
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Customize all variables to test different scenarios
- **Data Visualization**: Real-time graphing of experiment data
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with interactive elements
- **Data Export**: Export experiment data for further analysis
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Focus on experiments without distractions

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/physics-virtual-lab.git
   cd physics-virtual-lab
2. The project requires no server-side components and can be opened directly in a browser. However, for best results:

   - Use a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled
   - For local development, you may want to use a simple HTTP server:
    ``` 
     python -m http.server 8000
    ```
    Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
